### Work
Building the software and infrastructure of [Heron
Data](https://www.herondata.io). As first employee, I'm learning a lot about
how to build companies at the very early stages.

### Bulgarian
Learning Bulgarian at least 1 hour per week, but I aim for more. Striving for
conversational fluency. Казвам се Цезар!

### Cycling
I bought a Brompton folding bicycle last year, and ever since I use it as my
main way of getting around London. 90% of the time, cycling somewhere is the
fastest way. 100% of the time it's the healthiest way.

### Reading
Focusing on books about how to build and run successful and sustainable
companies.
