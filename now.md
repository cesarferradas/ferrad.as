### Career

Working as a Senior Software Engineer at [Octopus
Energy](https://octopus.energy). Really excited to be working for a
tech-forward, renewable energy company with incredible people.

### Learning

Re-starting Bulgarian lessons so I can progress to the next level. I feel like
I've been stationary at intermediate level for too long.

### Health

Getting back into running. Aiming to be able to run 5k weekly as a baseline.
Working up to that slowly as I hadn't ran properly for many years.

Cycling to work more often now that I moved closer to work.
