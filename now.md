### Work
Building software at [Humaans](https://humaans.io). Enjoying the change to a
full-stack JavaScript role. Learning about new tools like FeathersJS and
Rescript.

### Bulgarian
Learning Bulgarian at least 1 hour per week, but I aim for more. Striving for
conversational fluency. Казвам се Цезар!

### Exercise
Joined an indoor bouldering gym and going as much as possible. Playing tennis
weekly.

### Reading
Working my way through the classics of Stoic philosophy: Epictetus, Marcus
Aurelius and Seneca.
