Working as a Lead Software Engineer at [Octopus Energy](https://octopus.energy).

Living in Sofia, Bulgaria with my wife. I spend time in London and Lima also.

Self-learning Bulgarian. After 4 years of weekly lessons, and now that I live
in Bulgaria, I'm able to teach myself whatever I'm missing.

Trying to establish a workout routine again. Signed up to a gym.

Hiking [Vitosha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitosha) on weekends.
