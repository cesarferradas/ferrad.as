Working as a Senior Software Engineer at [Octopus Energy](https://octopus.energy).

Spending my time between London, Sofia and Lima. London is a nice base, but my
family is elsewhere.

Still learning Bulgarian. I have a weekly lesson with a teacher. Keeps me
accountable.

Getting back into running. Aiming to run 5k weekly as a minimum.

Going on long hikes in nature on the weekends.
