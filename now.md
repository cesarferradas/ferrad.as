**Working** as a Backend Engineer at [Kraken](https://kraken.tech/), part of [Octopus Energy Group](https://octopus.energy). Really excited to be working for a renewable energy company with incredible people. And I've sorely missed Python!

Still **learning** Bulgarian although less intensely than before.

**Reading** mostly fiction nowadays. Right now I'm reading The Midnight Library by Matt Haig.
