Working as a Lead Software Engineer at [Octopus Energy](https://octopus.energy).

Living in Sofia, Bulgaria with my wife. I spend time in London and Lima also.

Training Krav Maga again after a 10 year hiatus. I had reached green belt in
the [South American Federation](https://kravmaga.com.br/en/federacao/). Now
starting again under the [European
Federation](https://www.krav-maga.net/en/federation/who-are-we/).

Still learning Bulgarian, but stopped taking lessons. After 4 years of weekly
lessons, I'm able to teach myself most things independently.
