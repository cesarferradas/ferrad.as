Hi there, my name is CÃ©sar.

I build software professionally and for fun.

As a generalist, I work with various programming languages, frameworks and
technologies to build, deploy and maintain systems across the stack.

I strive to support open source software I use. I've contributed to
[Flasgger](//github.com/flasgger/flasgger){:target="_blank"},
[RQ](//github.com/rq/rq){:target="_blank"} and
[Tofu Auth](//github.com/calleluks/Tofu){:target="_blank"}.

Besides coding, I really enjoy language learning, chess and making coffee.

See [what I'm doing now](/now).
