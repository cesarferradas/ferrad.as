Resourceful and curious Software Engineer. I enjoy building software for early
stage startups and for fun. I find that's where the most interesting technical
challenges are, which call for creative solutions.

I'm a generalist at heart so I love working with different technologies and
have built systems in various languages, with and without frameworks.

I try to contribute to open-source tools I use, like
[Flasgger](https://github.com/flasgger/flasgger/pull/340),
[Python RQ](https://github.com/rq/rq/pull/1514) and
[Tofu Auth](https://github.com/calleluks/Tofu/pull/44).

I studied Computer Science with a minor in Entrepreneurship at University
College London.
