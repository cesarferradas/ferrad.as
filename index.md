Resourceful and curious Software Engineer. I enjoy building software for early
stage startups and for fun. I find that's where the most interesting technical
challenges are, which call for creative solutions.

I'm a generalist at heart so I love working with different technologies and
have built systems in various languages, with and without frameworks.

When open-source tools are missing something that I think would be useful, I
try to contribute to their development like with
[Flasgger](https://github.com/flasgger/flasgger/pull/340),
[Python RQ](https://github.com/rq/rq/pull/1514) and [Tofu
Auth](https://github.com/calleluks/Tofu/pull/44).

I studied Computer Science with a minor in Entrepreneurship at University
College London, but I've learnt the most about building good quality systems
from actually trying to code stuff!
