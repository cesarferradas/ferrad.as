# About

Hi there, my name is **CÃ©sar**. I build software for fun and work.

As a generalist, I work with different technologies and build, deploy and
maintain systems using various languages, with and without frameworks, across
the stack.

Where possible I try to support open source software. I'm the main author of
[Heron Python](https://pypi.org/project/heron-data/){:target="_blank"} and
have contributed to
[Flasgger](https://github.com/flasgger/flasgger/pull/340){:target="_blank"},
[RQ](https://github.com/rq/rq/pull/1514){:target="_blank"} and
[Tofu Auth](https://github.com/calleluks/Tofu/pull/44){:target="_blank"}.

Besides coding, I also greatly enjoy learning languages, playing chess and
brewing coffee.

See [what I'm doing now](/now).
