Hi there, my name is CÃ©sar ðŸ‘‹

I build software for early-stage companies. I find that's where the most
interesting technical challenges are, which call for creative solutions.

As a generalist, I love working with different technologies and have built
systems in various languages, with and without frameworks.

Where possible, I strive to support open-source software. I'm the author
of [Heron Python](https://pypi.org/project/heron-data/){:target="_blank"} and
have contributed to
[Flasgger](https://github.com/flasgger/flasgger/pull/340){:target="_blank"},
[RQ](https://github.com/rq/rq/pull/1514){:target="_blank"} and
[Tofu Auth](https://github.com/calleluks/Tofu/pull/44){:target="_blank"}.

I studied Computer Science with a minor in Entrepreneurship at
[UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}..

My other interests include language-learning, chess, coffee, minimalism and
financial independence.

See [what I'm doing now](/now). Read [my articles](/blog). Find me on
[LinkedIn]({{ site.author.linkedin }}){:target="_blank"}.
