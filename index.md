Hi there, my name is CÃ©sar ðŸ‘‹. I build software for fun, and it also happens to
be my profession.

As a generalist, I love working with different technologies and build, deploy and
maintain systems using various languages, with and without frameworks, end-to-end.

Where possible, I strive to support open-source software. I'm the author
of [Heron Python](https://pypi.org/project/heron-data/){:target="_blank"} and
have contributed to
[Flasgger](https://github.com/flasgger/flasgger/pull/340){:target="_blank"},
[RQ](https://github.com/rq/rq/pull/1514){:target="_blank"} and
[Tofu Auth](https://github.com/calleluks/Tofu/pull/44){:target="_blank"}.

I studied Computer Science with a minor in Entrepreneurship at
[UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}.

My other interests include learning languages, chess, coffee, minimalism and
financial independence.

See [what I'm doing now](/now).
