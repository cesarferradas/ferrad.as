Hi there, I'm CÃ©sar ðŸ‘‹

I'm a resourceful and curious Software Engineer.

I enjoy building software for early-stage companies. I find that's where the
most interesting technical challenges are, which call for creative solutions.

I'm a generalist at heart so I love working with different technologies and
have built systems in various languages, with and without frameworks.

I try to contribute to open-source tools I use, like
[Flasgger](https://github.com/flasgger/flasgger/pull/340),
[Python RQ](https://github.com/rq/rq/pull/1514) and
[Tofu Auth](https://github.com/calleluks/Tofu/pull/44).

I studied Computer Science with a minor in Entrepreneurship at University
College London.

My other interests include language-learning, chess, coffee, minimalism and
financial independence.
