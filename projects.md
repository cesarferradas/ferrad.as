# Projects

Some of the projects I've created over the years.

- **[isitbankholiday.com](https://isitbankholiday.com)**:
    A website that tells you if today, or any other day in the future, is a
    bank holiday in England and Wales.

- **[redes.bio](https://redes.bio)**:
    A simple URL tree or "link in bio" app for Spanish speakers.

- **[Heron Python](https://pypi.org/project/heron-data/)**:
    A Python library to integrate with the [Heron Data API](https://docs.herondata.io/api).
