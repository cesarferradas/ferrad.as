Hello! My name is **CÃ©sar Ferradas**. I'm from Lima, Peru.

I'm a Software Engineer and Systems Architect with over 10 years of programming
experience and 5+ years in professional roles at both startups and large
companies.

I enjoy solving difficult problems and have deep expertise in software
development across the stack, as well as in Cloud Architecture, DevOps, and
Site Reliability.

Passionate about sustainable software, I focus on simple code design,
scalability and efficiency. I strive to work with companies which have a
positive social or environmental impact.

I am committed to supporting open-source software. I was the creator and main
author of [Heron Python](https://pypi.org/project/heron-data/) and have
contributed to projects such as [Flasgger](//github.com/flasgger/flasgger),
[RQ](//github.com/rq/rq) and [Tofu Auth](//github.com/calleluks/Tofu). The
website you're on right now is [open-source](https://github.com/cesarferradas/ferrad.as).

I hold a BSc in Computer Science with a minor in Entrepreneurship from
[University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), where I graduated with
First Class honours.
