title: "Domain modelling in startups: how and how much?"
---

*TLDR: if you understand some real world concept, even if it's not much, model it.*

Here's a situation: you're starting a brand new product or big feature in
unknown territory. This is likely if you're a startup working on a first
product, a scale-up working on a new idea or a big company.

The common thread is that there are a lot of unknowns, the initial version of
what you build will most definitely be changed, if not thrown out completely.

So its natural to ask: should I bother with domain modeling and domain-driven
development? This question is at the intersection of product speed and good
engineering, so how do you tackle it?

A common mistake is to assume that because you don't know much about a problem
space, that you can't model it. But in my experience, it's good to at least
come up with domain models that make sense based on what you know.

Here's an example:

At Heron Data, when we started, we didn't do much of this because implicitly we
assumed we didn't need to, given that "things are uncertain, and will change".

Should you domain model when early in a company or product? you dont know much,
things can change

Usually seems boilerplate code
However, the exercise isn't necessarily about code
more about understanding the problem

Very quickly app will grow exponentially. If you have bad modelling, it will be
hard, names will be confused/overloaded, operation/function names will not make
intuitive sense.

talk about other people's examples!
