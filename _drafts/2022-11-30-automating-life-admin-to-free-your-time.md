title: How to optimise your life to have more free time
---

Every day, week or month, we spend a significant amount of our free time doing
repetitive but necessary life admin tasks. Things like paying bills, buying
groceries, working out and planning social events with friends can take up a
lot of your non-working hours if done sporadically and unintentionally.

Being an engineer at heart, I find these inefficiencies fascinating and look
for ways to streamline them. So if you've ever wondered how to automate your
life admin to gain more free time, keep reading.

You can broadly separate efficiency gains into two categories: automations and
habits. Automations involve things you set up once with some upfront time cost,
and then computers do the rest, forever, with minimal intervention. Habits rely
on your human work, but in an organised and almost "mindless" fashion.

## Automations

### Standing orders and direct debits

Pay your rent via a monthly standing order (US term?).

Set up direct debits for all bills that offer it (credit cards, utilities,
subscriptions, gym memberships, etc).

### Subscribe to food deliveries

Gousto has been great for us. We guarantee healthy, quick to cook meals every
week for a reasonable price. This covers most dinners and lunches. For
breakfast, it's easy to put something together. For the occasional times we
don't have a recipe lined up, we can eat out or make something simple.

## Habits

### Pick a time and day to do admin

Every last Friday of the month, when I get paid, I sit down at 8am
and sort out anything that can't be done via automations. For example, I buy
investments, pay some memberships and so on.

### Have a schedule for working out

### Do two things at once

Usually advice focus, but depends

A great example of this is cycling to your workplace if possible. This means
that you embed a "life admin" task into a time you have to do
