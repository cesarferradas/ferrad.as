title: A very effective and fun language learning method

Language acq, natural
Anki
First flashcards, words, add to Anki, then  eventually you can read some
sentences
Get a teacher! Book them weekly. Ensures necessary consistency. Do not skip
this part.
Self learning: after lessons with a teacher, gather all sentences you missed
words, or words didn't know. Add them to anki. Why not automate? This process
itself is humbling, shows what you don't know, and the process of entering
manually helps reinforce.
Review flashcards daily, just 15 minutes per day. This is sustainable enough to
do daily, so you get frequency.
