title: A very effective and fun language learning method

Language acq, natural
Anki
First flashcards, words, add to Anki, then  eventually you can read some
sentences
Get a teacher! Book them weekly. Ensures necessary consistency. Do not skip
this part.
Self learning: after lessons with a teacher, gather all sentences you missed
words, or words didn't know. Add them to anki. Why not automate? This process
itself is humbling, shows what you don't know, and the process of entering
manually helps reinforce.
Review flashcards daily, just 15 minutes per day. This is sustainable enough to
do daily, so you get frequency.
Consistency is needed: get a class/teacher once a week

In that class, read and translate as much as possible

Note down unknown words in a notebook / digital flashcard system like Anki.

When bored, do the flashcards on your phone.

Just keep doing it. Probably takes 1 hour class + 15 minutes here and there, so
just 2 hours a week.

Not the _fastest_ way of learning, but a sustainable one for sure. That's what
matters because you'll stick to it for years and advance that way.

I've been learning Bulgarian for just over a year, and I'm currently between B1
and B2 (intermediate) according to my teacher. I could likely be more advanced
if I dedicated more time, but I have a full time job and other life commitments
that are also important, as do most people. I haven't burnt out or got bored,
that in itself is an achievement.
